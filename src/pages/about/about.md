I am a designer who specialises in interactive experiences and product strategies. 

I was part of a team that transformed Burberry's eCommerce and digital presence from 2009-2017

My work ranged from the design of burberry.com to tying our physical product development with emerging digital opportunities.

I am now a Principal Designer at YOOX NET-A-PORTER Group, developing a design system and working on the future of luxury commerce.

I am probably a Digital Technologist.
